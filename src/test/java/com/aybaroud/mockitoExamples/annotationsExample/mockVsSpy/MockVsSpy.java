/**
 * the difference between spy and mock in Mockito API? Both can be used to mock methods or fields.
 * The difference is that in mock, you are creating a complete mock or fake object while in spy, there is
 * the real object and you just spying or stubbing specific methods of it.
 * When using mock objects, the default behavior of the method when not stub is do nothing. Simple means,
 * if its a void method, then it will do nothing when you call the method or if its a method with a return then it may return null, empty or the default value.
 * While in spy objects, of course, since it is a real method, when you are not stubbing the method, then it will call the real method behavior.
 * If you want to change and mock the method, then you need to stub it.
 * If you want to be safe and avoid calling external services and just want to test the logic inside of the unit, then use mock.
 * If you want to call external service and perform calling of real dependency, or simply say, you want to run the program as
 * it is and just stub specific methods, then use spy. So thatâ€™s the difference between spy and mock in mockito.
